### SCRAPANYUM ###

Scraping websites with Django, Selenium and Scrapy


This project is divided in 3 Django apps:

1-Core: Administration and task creation dashboard.
2-Scraper: Scrapy spiders, included 2 examples, with or without Selenium
3-Proxifier: Anti scraping and bot detector countermeasures for selenium

A SQL file is included with the configuration for the 2 example scrapers.
Django settings and WSGI file are in PROJECT folder

This project was created as a tool for my last job, and is in no way intented as a commercial product.

Feel free to message me with improvements, my intention is to keep this boilerplate updated and useful.
