You can view past requests, and re-execute them. Selecting a transaction in the History list will show the full request/response.\n    For each transaction in the list, the request and response are shown, as well as the Elapsed Time and Content-Length (The value used is the Content-Length response header if available, and the size of the response body otherwise.)\n    Each column in the history list is resizable and re-orderable and can be hidden via the column picker. The ordering and width of each column are persisted.\n    Double-clicking a row in the history will show you a raw text version of the request and response\n    You can edit raw requests by double-clicking a row in the history list, or clicking the Edit Raw Request button. This is useful for easily viewing the request all at once, or for making quick tweaks to a previous request, such as adding or changing headers. This is\n    the same behavior as double-clicking a transaction in the transaction history list.\n    Recent URLs, header names, and content types are remembered across sessions, and can easily be selected from drop-down lists.\n\nUsage\n\n    HttpRequester can be opened via the Toolbar button (the green/red arrow icon), or opened via the Tools menu.

(You can also hit the Delete key)\n    You can copy a request/response to clipboard for pasting into bug report, etc. You can also copy existing requests from the clipboard by clicking the Paste Request button, and then executing the request. Select multiple requests at once by holding down CTRL while selecting another request from the list.\n    Press the <Esc> key to close the HttpRequester window\n    Save and load stored requests: To save a request, click on a request in the history list and click Save Request. You can optionally give the request a name.\n    To load a request, click on Load Request - that will bring up a list of all saved requests.
