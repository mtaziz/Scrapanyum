You can view past requests, and re-execute them. Selecting a transaction in the History list will show the full request/response.\n    For each transaction in the list, the request and response are shown, as well as the Elapsed Time and Content-Length (The value used is the Content-Length response header if available, and the size of the response body otherwise.)\n    Each column in the history list is resizable and re-orderable and can be hidden via the column picker. The ordering and width of each column are persisted.\n    Double-clicking a row in the history will show you a raw text version of the request and response\n    You can edit raw requests by double-clicking a row in the history list, or clicking the Edit Raw Request button. This is useful for easily viewing the request all at once, or for making quick tweaks to a previous request, such as adding or changing headers. This is\n    the same behavior as double-clicking a transaction in the transaction history list.\n    Recent URLs, header names, and content types are remembered across sessions, and can easily be selected from drop-down lists.\n\nUsage\n\n    HttpRequester can be opened via the Toolbar button (the green/red arrow icon), or opened via the Tools menu. Alternatively the shortcut CTRL-ALT-P will bring up HttpRequester.\n    You can press the Delete Request button to remove a selected transaction from history list. (You can also hit the Delete key)\n    You can copy a request/response to clipboard for pasting into bug report, etc. You can also copy existing requests from the clipboard by clicking the Paste Request button, and then executing the request. Select multiple requests at once by holding down CTRL while selecting another request from the list.\n    Press the <Esc> key to close the HttpRequester window\n    Save and load stored requests: To save a request, click on a request in the history list and click Save Request. You can optionally give the request a name.\n    To load a request, click on Load Request - that will bring up a list of all saved requests. You can select any request to load it into your history to view it, or you can click the Execute button to execute it immediately.\n\nAdvanced Preferences: (via about:config):\nIncreasing number of items in history\nextensions.httprequester.maxhistory - maximum number of requests to keep\nextensions.httprequester.url.maxhistory - maximum number of URLs to keep\nextensions.httprequester.contenttype.maxhistory - maximum number of content types to keep\nextensions.httprequester.header.maxhistory - maximum number of header names to keep\n\nYou can add custom methods to the list of available HTTP methods.\nTo add new Methods: enter \"about:config\" in your URL bar.

Record and replay repetitive tasks. If you're tired of manually visiting the same sites, filling out forms, downloading files and extracting data, then iMacros is for you! Save time, effort and money with iMacros browser automation!","fullDescription":"iMacros was designed to automate the most repetitive tasks on the web. If there’s an activity you have to do repeatedly, just record it in iMacros. The next time you need to do it, the entire macro will run at the click of a button! With iMacros, you can quickly and easily fill out web forms, remember passwords, create a webmail notifier, download files from other sites, scrape the Web (extract data from multiple sites), and more. You can keep the macros on your computer for your own use, or share them with others by embedding them on your homepage, blog, company intranet or any social bookmarking service. The uses are limited only by your imagination!\n\nHere are just a few examples of how you can use iMacros to automate your web browser.\n\n(1) Form Filler & Password Manager\n\nWith iMacros for Firefox, you no longer need to check the same sites every day, remembering passwords, and filling out web forms. iMacros is the only form filler that can autofill web forms that stretch over several pages. All information is stored in human-readable, plain text files that can be easily edited. Passwords are stored securely with 256-Bit encryption. Users memorize only one master password and iMacros remembers all the others, providing a truly automated login and form filling experience.\n\n(2) Automated Download & Upload\n\niMacros can automate the download of images, files, or entire pages (with or without images). In the other direction, it can automate the upload of data to websites. You can use variables inside the macros and import data from CSV files. iMacros includes a user agent switcher as well as image blocking functions. When combined and controlled with Javascript, the recorded macros can script even very complex tasks.\n\n(3) Data Extraction, Web Scraping/Mining & Enterprise Data Mash-Ups\n\nThe iMacros EXTRACT command automatically reads data from a website and exports it to CSV files – the exact opposite of filling out forms. iMacros includes full Unicode support and works with every language, including multi-byte languages such as Chinese. You can use this feature to download stock quotes, gather and compare web store prices, and more.\n\n(4) Web Testing\n\nWeb professionals can use iMacros for functional, performance, and regression testing of web applications. The built-in STOPWATCH command captures precise web page response times. iMacros also includes support for many AJAX elements.\n\n(5) Social Scripting (Bookmarklets)\n\nSharing your favorite iMacros with friends and colleagues is easy. Simply right-click the macro to add it as a bookmark, or select \"Run Everywhere\" and embed the complete macro in a simple link. You can send the link to others, or embed it on your homepage, blog, or company intranet. Instead of telling your site visitors how to fill out a form, let iMacros do it for them. All the information is stored inside the link as a text string, with nothing stored on our servers, which is why iMacros bookmarklets work on intranets too.\n\n(6) Other Uses\n\nFor more ideas on how to use iMacros, please visit www.imacros.net and/or our active support forum at forum.imacros.net.\n\niMacros is extremely versatile and can be combined with other extensions such as Greasemonkey, Web Developer, Firebug, Stylish, Download Statusbar, NoScript, PDF Download, Foxmarks, Fasterfox, All-in-One Sidebar, Megaupload, Foxyproxy, Flashblock and Adblock.\n\niMacros for Firefox is free for personal and commercial use. Download the add-on today to start simplifying your Web tasks and sharing your macros with others!\n\nSave time, effort and money with iMacros browser automation!","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/10/10472.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/10/10472.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","caption":"iMacros for Firefox"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/10/10446.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/10/10446.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","caption":"iMacros Sidebar (Press F8 to show or hide it)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/10/10654.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/10/10654.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","caption":"Right-click to delete or rename the Internet macros"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/10/10712.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/10/10712.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","caption":"All activity is recorded in human-readable, html-like commands with full Unicode support."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/10/10989.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/10/10989.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","caption":"For maximum security, iMacros uses the Firefox Password Manager and stores passwords with 256-bit AES encryption."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/14/14818.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/14/14818.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","caption":"Add a reference to iMacros to your bookmarks or create a link with a \"built-in\" macro.
